line: Obviously, Iâ€™l have to use a rover. And guess what? They werenâ€™t designed for massive overland journeys.

line: And because I need to bundle up anyway, I can deactivate the heater outright and use all the power for motion (minus a negligible amount for computer, life support, etc.)

line: Things started out fine. I drove to a nice flat spot a kilometer from the Hab, then started going back and forth over a 500m stretch.
line: Turning the heater on, I drove straight back to the Hab.
line: The RTG (Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator) is a big box of Plutonium. But not the kind used in nuclear bombs. No, no. This
line: I'm exaggerating a little. The Plutonium is inside a bunch of pelets, each one sealed and insulated to prevent radiation leakage even if the outer container is breached. So for the Ares Program, they took the risk.
line: As soon as the rovers were un-stowed and activated, Commander Lewis had the joy of disposing of the RTG. She detached it from

line: I set out at first light and drove laps around the Hab, trying to stay on untouched ground. The first battery lasted just under two hours.
line: The RTG is a generator. Itâ€™s a paltry amount of power, compared to what the rover consumes, but itâ€™s not nothing. Itâ€™s 100 Watts.
line: In the long term, Iâ€™l need to bring the Oxygenator. But itâ€™s big and I donâ€™t want to screw with it right now. So Iâ€™l rely on O2 and CO2

line: I quickly realized I didnâ€™t give a crap about the condition of the other panels. I went back to my rover, cut some strips of Hab material, then braided them in to a primitive but strong rope. I canâ€™t take credit for it being strong. Thank NASA for thaline: Now for my next feat: Getting it on the roof.

line: I'l have to make structural changes to that trailer. And by â€œstructural changesâ€ I mean â€œcut a big hole in the hul.â€ Then I can move the Big Three in and use Hab canvas to loosely cover the hole. It'l baloon out when I pressurize the rover, but itline: takes 160 seconds to drill.
line: The drill expects 28.8V and pulls 9 Amps. The only lines that can handle that are

line: I'l have to clean it thoroughly every few hours as dust accumulates.
line: I average a hole every 3.5 minutes. That includes the occasional breather to let the dril cool off.

line: The pop tent is the basis of my â€œbedroom,â€ but not the whole thing. It's not very big; not much more space than the rover. But it has the airlock attachment so it's a great place to start. My plan is to double the floor area and double the height. Thaline: meters. I want to be able to stand! I don't think that's too much to ask.
line: shapes of canvas I'l need. I needed to not fuck this up, so I triple-checked everything. I even made a model out of paper.
line: I'l eat â€œHalf-wayâ€ when I reach the 1600km mark, and â€œArrivalâ€ when I get there.
line: atmospheric pressure. Of course, everything in the Hab had a crash course in depressurization a few months back. But this time would be
line: The dome of the Hab is mostly supported by air pressure, but there are flexible reenforcing poles across the inside to hold the canvas up.

line: popping? No? Ok... What was that!? Oh, nothing? Ok...
line: whole thing inside the Hab. Why not? It's just canvas. I can rol it up and take it out an airlock when I'm done.
line: It took a little while to bring it up to par, and I had to disable some alarms on the suit. (â€œHey, I'm pretty sure the helmet's not on!â€). It depleted most of the N2 tank, but was finaly able to bring the pressure up.

line: to get the same energy. It'l turn his 45 sol trip in to 225 sols. He'l miss the Hermes flyby.â€
line: â€œWel...â€ Teddy said. â€œShit.â€
line: Back on Earth, universities and governments are wiling to pay milions to get their hands on Mars rocks. I'm using them as balast.
line: â€œJohanssen,â€ Lewis said. â€œWhat the deal with the reactor?â€
line: â€œAl right, keep an eye on it. Beck, how's life support?â€
line: â€œIn Airlock 2. It's the only place I can be without people tripping over me.â€
line: â€œMilion-mile-high club,â€ Martinez said. â€œNice!â€
line: The rover has an electric heater that pushes air with a smal fan. I don't use it for anything because the RTG provides al the heat I need.
line: Once the pressure is gone, I pul the canvas in and fold it. Then I detach it from the outer hatch and close the outer door. This is the
line: Then I set up the bedroom. Pretty much the reverse of the sequence I use to stow it. Ultimately it's the airlock that inflates it. In a way, the bedroom is just an extension of the airlock.
line: The test was a success. I'l be ready on time.
line: The Hab is a shel of its former self. I've robbed it of al critical components and a big chunk of its canvas. I've looted that poor Hab for everything it could give me, and in return it's kept me alive for a year and a half. It's like The Giving Tree.

line: LOG ENTRY: SOL 462
line: Latitude and Longitude. That's the key. The first is easy. Ancient sailors on Earth figured that one out right away. Earth's 23.5 degree axis points at Polaris. Mars has a tilt of just over 25 degrees, so it's pointed at Deneb.
line: during that time. I note the time when it does. Then I plug it in to a nasty formula I worked out and I know my longitude.
line: â€œON TRACK FOR SOL 495 ARRIVAL.â€

line: The rover was not so lucky. It continued tumbling down the hil, bouncing the traveler around like clothes in a dryer. After 20 meters,
line: Venkat put a hand on his chin. "Do we have any information on the state of the rover pressure vessel?"
line: "Go on," Venkat said.
line: Yeah.
line: .
line: more sols. That's it.
line: The trailer's in a precarious situation. It's upside-down and sitting on the inflated roof. I'm not sure which god smiled down on me and kept that baloon from popping, but I'm grateful. My first priority wil be righting it. The longer it puts weight on thline: â€œYou got me,â€ she said. â€œHe left a detailed status report. I just decided to lie for no reason.â€
line: I started out pretty sore. I had to sleep on the wal of the rover. The bedroom won't work when the airlock is facing up. I did get to use the bedroom, somewhat. I folded it up and used it as a bed.
line: I plugged one end in to the battery and the other in to the infamous sample dril. Then walked off with the dril to find solid ground.
line: I untied the power line, liberated the dril bit, and returned to the rover. I gave it a ful system's check. That's a boring-as-hel task but I had to do it. Every system and subsystem was working correctly.
line: Long story short: I ran out of daylight. I hate to leave the trailer sitting on its baloon for another night, but there's not much else I can do. I figure it's survived a whole day like that. It's probably stable for now.
line: I can make this happen by tying off the cable to the rear of the trailer and towing with the rover. But if I tried that without digging a hole first, the trailer would just slide along the ground. I needed it to tip up. I needed a hole for the nose to falline: I'l spend the rest of the evening enjoying a potato. And by â€œenjoyingâ€ I mean â€œhating so much I want to kil people.â€
line: as a liquid in need of heating.
line: The hoses that connected the rover and trailer were designed wel, and released without breaking. I simply snapped them back in to
line: ngâ€.
line: the MAV, which wil take me away from the crater wal. I'l be back to enjoying the entire day's sunlight instead of just half of it.
line: procedure soon?â€
line: early morning, finishing around noon.â€ She checked an application on her laptop. â€œNoon on Sol 504 wil be 11:41am this Wednesday here
line: always drive, and he was the slowest, most cautious driver who ever took the wheel.
line: day. I could go further, I stil have 15% battery power or so, but I want to get as much daylight on my solar cels as I can.
line: the sol after tomorrow.
line: That is an exceptionally good idea! I won't have to wander around looking for the thing. I'm going straight to it.
line: came to a stop 20 meters away.
line: Chapter 25
line: And then I'l have a boring conversation with NASA. The content may be interesting, but the 14-minute transmission time between here
line: you know, the MAV will need to lose some weight to make the intercept. We're going
line: â€œYes, it's ready.â€ Bruce said. â€œBut you're not going to like it.â€
line: has. It brought enough to make 19,397kg of fuel, as it was designed to do. If we can give it more hydrogen, it can make more.â€
line: to 7,300kg. That's accounting for the bonus fuel. So the rest of this booklet is how to remove over five thousand kilograms from the ship.â€
line: piloting. It was remotely landed, after al.â€
line: Also, the secondary and tertiary comm systems can go.â€
line: â€œSure,â€ Bruce said. â€œThe nose airlock alone is 400kg. The windows are pretty damn heavy, too. And they're connected by Hul Panel
line: â€œPretty much, yeah.â€
line: Bruce fel silent.
line: [08:41]MAV: You fucking kidding me?
line: LOG ENTRY: SOL 506
line: So yeah, it'l be annoying, but al it costs me is time. And I'm actualy doing wel on that front. I have 43 more sols before Hermes flies
line: Then, they had me run a ful diagnostic on the MAV. That's in much better shape. Everything's sleek and pristine and perfectly
line: â€œWe only got a week of remote launch training,â€ Johanssen said. â€œIt was only supposed to happen if we scrubbed before landing. We'd

line: â€œI'd like to know your plan for recovering Mark.â€
line: â€œWe've got a lot of leeway,â€ Lewis said. â€œThe launch wil be 52 minutes before the intercept and it takes 12 minutes. As soon as
line: â€œAye, Commander.â€
line: Periodicaly, I suit up, crawl into the airlock with as much junk as I can fit, and dump it outside. The area around the MAV looks like
line: wearing my EVA suit, I depressurized the trailer and back-filed it with pure oxygen at one fourth of an atmosphere. Then I opened a
line: many times before but: Hurray for standardized valve systems!
line: the system and I'm testing it out.
line: work. That's not to say they're easy. I spent the last 3 days removing Hull Panel
line: I think I'm done.
line: â€œEverything other than catastrophic failures,â€ Johanssen corrected.
line: â€œHe might be in bad shape when I get him,â€ Beck said. â€œThe stripped-down MAV wil get up to 12 g's during the launch. He could be
line: â€œFinal checks for this shift are complete,â€ Mitch said in to his headset. â€œTimekeeper.â€
line: screen.â€
line: â€œNothing?â€
line: Last night, I ate my final meal pack. It's the first good meal I've had in weeks. I'm leaving 41 potatoes behind. That's how close I came to starvation.
line: About fucking time.
line: ready for preflight checklist, Commander.â€
line: A mild cheer coruscated through the crowds worldwide.
line: â€œMission control, this is Hermes Actual,â€ Lewis reported. â€œWe are go for launch and wil proceed on schedule. We are T minus four
line: â€œTel that asshole no barrel-rols.â€
line: â€œFirst what?â€
line: â€œI know what the Commander said, but if I need a few more meters, I want you to cut me loose. I have an MMU, I can get back
line: â€œMain engines start,â€ said Martinez.
line: Having anticipated this, he had placed a folded up shirt behind his head in the helmet. As his head pressed firmly in to the makeshift
line: â€œI'm not getting the power I need!â€ Martinez said.
line: ahead. â€œThat's nice,â€ he thought.
line: â€œHe'l get to orbit,â€ Johanssen said, â€œbut the intercept course may be compromised.â€
line: â€œMain shutdown in 4,â€ Johanssen said â€œ3... 2... 1... Shutdown.â€
line: â€œI can make that work,â€ Beck said over the radio.
line: â€œVogel,â€ Lewis continued, â€œhow far can we deflect in 39 minutes with the ion engines?â€
line: â€œIn 39 minutes we'd deflect...â€ Johanssen quickly typed, â€œ72 kilometers!â€
line: Venkat strained to hear to speaker over the murmur of the VIPs in the observation booth. Through the glass he saw Mitch throw his
line: â€œAbout 90 miles per hour,â€ Venkat said. â€œThere's no hope of Beck grabbing Watney at that speed.â€
line: â€œCommander,â€ Beck radioed. â€œHe's wearing a surface EVA suit, right?â€
line: â€œThere's got to be something,â€ Lewis said. â€œSomething we can do. Anything.â€
line: people in history had personaly seen this view.
line: â€œWe're working on getting you,â€ Lewis said. â€œThere was a complication in the launch.â€
line: â€œBeck,â€ Lewis said. â€œI'm coming around to your way of thinking. How fast can you get going if you're untethered?â€
line: â€œNo idea,â€ Watney said.
line: â€œNot the whole idea, but part of it,â€ she said. â€œUsing atmosphere as thrust. Martinez, get Vogel's station up and running.â€
line: â€œPlenty of air in the ship,â€ Lewis said. â€œIt'd give us a good kick.â€
line: â€œOk I have the numbers,â€ Martinez said. â€œA breach at the VAL, with the bridge and reactor room sealed off, would accelerate us 29
line: â€œWhat kind of jolt wil we feel with that breach?â€ Lewis asked to Martinez.
line: â€œGot it,â€ Annie said, jogging to the door.
line: â€œIt is of course dangerous to set off an explosive device on a spacecraft,â€ Vogel said pragmaticaly.
line: close and seal the doors to the reactor room.â€
line: â€œWe're going to have to literaly blow up one of the doors,â€ Lewis explained. â€œI'd rather we kil the inner one. I want the outer door
line: â€œGet to it,â€ Lewis said. â€œAnd Vogel, you're in a hurry. You have to make the bomb, set it up, get back to Airlock 2, suit up,
line: â€œVogel's making a bomb.â€
line: Lacking time to sit down and do the math, he estimated.
line: â€œSehr, sehr, gefÃ¤hrlich,â€
line: Johanssen watched until he was no longer in view, then returned to the lighting panel. She had deactivated it earlier from her
line: â€œMm,â€ Johanssen said.
line: â€œStandby.â€ Lewis said.
line: â€œCopy,â€ said Martinez, executing the attitude adjustment.
line: â€œYou ready, Johanssen?â€ Lewis asked.
line: â€œOn the phone with the President,â€ Teddy said. â€œDo you think this wil work?â€
line: ignition temperature of the sugar. What would have been a minor fizzle in Earth's atmosphere became an uncontroled conflagration in the
line: â€œDamage?â€ Martinez said.
line: â€œI'm going to jump out,â€ Beck said. â€œShould get me another two or three meters per second.â€
line: â€œAffirmative,â€ she replied.
line: â€œCopy.â€
line: â€œDr. Beck,â€ Vogel said. â€œWe have past closest approach point and you are now getting further away. You have 169 meters of tether
line: Beck's course took him to the chair where he clumsily colided with Watney. The two gripped each others' arms to keep Beck from
line: â€œRelative velocity to Hermes: 12 meters per second,â€ Johanssen said.
line: Vogel managed to find the balance. After a few seconds of tense, gut-feel physics, Vogel felt the force on the tether abate.
line: â€œYes!â€ Martinez yeled.
line: â€œGuess you don't need the red folder today,â€ Venkat said.
line: It's true, you know. In space, no one can hear you scream like a little girl.
line: It's been a while since I washed... anything.
line: Next week would be busy. He would be meeting the Ares-6 Engineer. He had read her file, but had never met her in person. He
