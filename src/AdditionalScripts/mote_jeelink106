line: I can create the O2 easily enough. It takes 20 hours for the MAV fuel plant to fil its 10L tank with CO2. The Oxygenator can turn it in
line: The concept is simple, but the execution wil be incredibly dangerous.
line: Presuming I donâ€™t fuck up with the Hydrazine, thereâ€™s stil the matter of burning hydrogen. Iâ€™m going to be setting a fire. In the Hab. On purpose.
line: Half-ration for dinner. Al I accomplished today was thinking up a plan thatâ€™l kil me, and that doesnâ€™t take much energy.
line: too much. Thereâ€™s more shade and a cooler temperature near the Hab, but fuck that. If theyâ€™re going to blow up, they can blow up a rover, not my house.
line: Meanwhile, the MAV fuel plant is stil working. Iâ€™ve already brought in one tank of CO2, vented it, and returned it for refiling.
line: Why? Because Hydrazine is very toxic. If I breathe too much of it I'l get major lung problems. If I get it on my skin, I'l have chemical burns for the rest of my life. I wasn't taking any chances.
line: Also, I have duct tape. Ordinary duct tape, like you buy at a hardware store. Turns out even NASA canâ€™t improve on duct tape.
line: The hydrogen wil be hot after the reaction, and it'l want to go up. So Iâ€™l let it go up the chimney, then burn it as it comes out.
line: I chipped his sacred religious item into long splinters using a pair of pliers and a screwdriver. I figure if thereâ€™s a God, He wonâ€™t mind, considering the situation Iâ€™m in.
line: Each Hydrazine tank holds a little over 50L, which would be enough to make 100L of water. Iâ€™m limited by my oxygen production, but
line: Reclaimer is trying to get the humidity down to sane levels. Nothing to be done about the heat. Thereâ€™s actualy no air-conditioning in the Hab. Mars is cold. Getting rid of excess heat isnâ€™t something we expected to deal with.
line: I am fucked and Iâ€™m gonna die!
line: So when I dip too low, I stop dicking with Hydrazine until I get the O2 back up to wel above 25L.
line: Thatâ€™s when I noticed the other O2 tank.
line: Chemistry is messy, so there's unburned Hydrogen in the air. Al around me. Mixed in with the oxygen. Just... hanging out. Waiting for a

line: If we fucked it up and broke the cels or rendered them useless, the Hab wouldnâ€™t be able to make power, and the mission would end.

line: My second try, the EVA suit threw everything off. Thereâ€™s a gentle flow of air coming out of the faceplate as the suit constantly replaces the missing air. So I shut the suit down, held my breath, and tried again. I had to be quick; the pressure was droline: Iâ€™l need to do some kind of repair to the faceplate. I donâ€™t know how just yet, but the patch kit and its pressure-resistant resin is

line: So I'l heat water with the RTG to create a heat reservoir, then I'l make the return air bubble through it. That way I don't have to worry about when the air comes in. And I won't have to deal with sudden temperature changes in the rover.

Then, over time, the levels dropped to normal. The regulator was doing its job. Gline: I checked up on the rover. Everything was fine. If I don't drive it, a single charge of the batteries could keep the regulator going for over a month (with the heater off). It's a pretty good safety margin to have. If al hel breaks loose on my trip I'l haline: First, I patched it up, then I cut strips of spare canvas to place over the seam. Now it has double-thickness and double sealing resin al around.

line: I considered skipping the Air Day. I could go another couple of days before I ran out of oxygen, and getting away from the storm is
line: Starting tomorrow, I can go directly toward Schiapareli. Which is good, cause I lost a lot of time. I went 540km due south while

line: to share the same atmosphere and I'l run a power line through one of the hoses. The rover wil serve as storage (because I won't need to
line: there!
line: Tomorrow night, I'l be in Giovanni Schiapareli's favorite hole!
line: Gravity did its work. The ramp compressed over time. But it did not compress evenly. Differing densities shrunk at different rates.
line: soft powder. With the entire surface covered by at least 5cm of dust, there were no visual hints to the sudden change.
line: The traveler was alive for now.
line: "Is this the entire crash site?" Bruce Ng asked.
line: "When was this taken?"
line: cowered. That's the kind of action hero I am.
line: Speaking of life support, the rover switched over to the local tanks when the valves shut. Good boy, Rover! Here's a Scooby-Snack.
line: I trashed 3 solar cels. They're under the rover and cracked al to hel. They might stil be able to piss out out a few watts, but I'm not
line: Also, I should spel out a message for NASA. They're probably worried.
line: â€œI'm space paparazzi now. The attitude comes with the job.â€
line: So today was focused on getting the rover righted.
line: I walked to the middle of the cord and puled it lateraly. The leverage advantage on the rover was huge. I only hoped it wouldn't break
line: Anyway, with the rover back on its wheels it was time to work on the trailer. Problem is, I'm in a crater.
line: The trailer was a bigger chalenge than the rover. I only had to tip the rover. I'd need to completely flip the trailer. That requires lot more force than yesterday's little leverage trick.
line: From there, it fel on to its wheels with a huge plume of dust.
line: I ventured in to the trailer today. Not an easy task. It's pretty cramped in there; I had to leave my EVA suit in the airlock.
line: The RTG's water tank was empty, which is no surprise. It was an open top, not intended to be turned upside down. The floor of the
line: Sort of.
line: Anyway. I'l drive slower. Like... a crawl. That should give me enough time to react if one wheel starts to sink. Also, the lower speed
line: everything working.â€
line: We can go through it then.â€
line: â€œI assume you'l be there?â€
line: driving the speed limit makes you a road hazard. I wanted to get out and push.
line: With luck, I'l get to eat â€œArrivalâ€ in a few sols.
line: Ok calm. Calm.
line: Somehow they messed with things to make a radial signal, however weak it may be. And I heard it!
line: He leaped in to the air several times, arms held high with fists clenched. Then he knelt on one knee and fist-pumped repeatedly.
line: on the whole time because there's no life support in there just yet.
line: [13:21]MAV: Thanks! No health or physical problems. The rover and trailer are
line: the way.
line: â€œI'm sure it was hard to trim down a ship that's already designed to be as light as possible,â€ Venkat said.
line: from that.â€
line: remove al nonessential gear. The med kit, tool kit, internal harnessing, straps, and anything else that isn't nailed down. And some stuff that is.
line: â€œSince Watney won't be flying the ship,â€ Bruce continued, â€œhe won't need any of those controls. We'l ditch the control panels and al
line: â€œThis is getting realy risky, Bruce.â€
line: â€œHab canvas? For a launch to orbit!?â€
line: â€œWe'l also have him remove the back panel of the pressure vessel. It's the only other panel he can remove with the tools on-hand.
line: â€œIt's about 4%.â€
line: hydrogen for the fuel plant. We'll send you procedures for that shortly.
line: It's a stupid idea and I'm not doing it.
line: But I didn't do anything to the soon-to-be-mutilated MAV today. Today was al about system checks. Now that I'm back in contact
line: â€œYeah,â€ Martinez said, scowling at his monitor. The words â€œColision with Terrainâ€ blinked accusingly.
line: â€œResetting the Sim,â€ Johanssen said. â€œAnything specific you want to try?â€
line: â€œKeep me posted if anything changes.â€
line: â€œHow fast a relative velocity can you handle, you think?â€
line: â€œYes it is,â€ Lewis corrected.
line: up systems weighing me down.
line: I'm turning my pee in to rocket fuel. It's easier than you'd think.
line: the water out. Now the trailer was ful of even more oxygen and also hydrogen. Pretty dangerous, actualy.
line: If I survive this, I'l tel people I pissed my way in to orbit.
line: no chance of survival?
line: [19:29]JOHANSSEN: I didn't type that! That was Martinez! I stepped away from the
line: teling me the failure odds, but I'm guessing they're the highest in history. Yuri Gagarin had a much more reliable and safe ship than I do.
line: â€œGood,â€ she said. â€œBeck, how about you?â€
line: â€œJa,â€ Vogel said.
line: â€œCopy that. Al stations: Flight Director shift change.â€ He took his headset off and rubbed his eyes.
line: â€œThey're camping out on the lawn, by the way,â€ Annie said. â€œReporters from al over the world. Our press rooms just don't have
line: â€œYes,â€ Venkat said. â€œSucks, doesn't it?â€
line: and wait. No matter what, we're launching on schedule.
line: From Trafalgar Square to Tienanmen Square to Times Square, they watched on giant screens. In offices they huddled around computer
line: â€œGo,â€ Johanssen said again.
line: â€œGo,â€ Johanssen responded.
line: â€œNot that we can do anything,â€ Mitch mumbled, â€œBut at least we'l know what's supposedly happening.â€
line: â€œI hadn't thought of it that way,â€ Martinez said, â€œbut yeah. I'm not going to be squashed against the back my seat. Weird.â€
line: They looked at Mars in silence for a while.
line: â€œYou are not the Commander.â€
line: â€œ4...3...2...â€
line: â€œVelocity 741 meters per second,â€ Johanssen quickly caled out. â€œAltitude 1350 meters.â€
line: Watney heard Lewis's voice in the distance. Like someone talking to him through a long tunnel. He vaguely wondered what she
line: As consciousness slipped away, he wondered where he could get a cool 5-sided bolt like that.
line: â€œWel below target altitude,â€ Johanssen said. â€œVelocity is good.â€
line: â€œCopy,â€ Lewis said. â€œJohanssen, got his orbit yet?â€
line: â€œGod damn it,â€ Martinez whispered.
line: â€œHow much do you need?â€
line: â€œAye, Commander.â€ Martinez said.
line: â€œWhat do attitude adjusters usualy do?â€
line: â€œI don't know,â€ he said. â€œAnd even if I did, I couldn't tel them in time.â€
line: â€œOn it,â€ Johanssen said. â€œI have to look up the frequencies in the tech specs. Gimme a second.â€
line: â€œ32 minutes,â€ Johanssen replied.
line: â€œAffirmative. That you, Commander?â€ Watney said.
line: â€œWe were able to correct the intercept range with Hermes's attitude thrusters. But there's a problem with the intercept velocity.â€
line: â€œHey,â€ Watney said over the radio, â€œI've got an idea.â€
line: â€œWe'l keep working on ideas,â€ Lewis said.
line: â€œYeah,â€ Martinez said. â€œIt estimates course corrections needed in the event of-â€
line: near the reactor.â€
line: â€œAffirmative, Commander,â€ Beck said. â€œ
line: â€œHouston,â€ Lewis's voice rang through Mission Control, â€œbe advised we are going to deliberately breach the VAL to produce thrust.â€
line: She thought for a moment. â€œVogel,â€ she radioed. â€œI need you to come back in and make a bomb.â€
line: â€œJohanssen?â€ Lewis said.
line: â€œRoger, Commander.â€
line: from being trashed by the decompress.â€
line: â€œFine so far, Commander,â€ Watney replied. â€œYou mentioned a plan?â€
line: can't let you guys blow the VAL.â€
line: container was as important as the explosive. A weak container would simply cause a firebal without much concussive force. A strong
line: He turned to face her. â€œBe careful setting up the bomb.â€
line: â€œHow do we set it off?â€ Johanssen said.
line: â€œRoger, Commander.â€ Martinez said, drifting to his station. â€œIt'l take me a sec... I need to do everything backward. The VAL's in
line: â€œThis has been kind of a weird day,â€ Beck said. â€œCommander, Vogel and I are in position.â€
line: â€œCopy,â€ Johanssen said. Unstowing the emergency seal, she plugged the entrance to the bridge. With a few turns of the crank, the job
line: â€œStrap in,â€ Lewis said.
line: â€œ5... 4... 3...â€ Johanssen said.
line: Vogel and Beck were pressed against the wal of Airlock 2. Lewis, Martinez, and Johanssen endured the acceleration in their seats. It
line: Johanssen typed quickly. â€œWe'l get within 22 meters and we're at 12 meters per second. We actualy got better than expected thrust.â€
line: â€œI have visual!â€ he said. â€œI can see MAV! Jesus, Mark, what did you do to that thing?â€
line: â€œNegative,â€ interrupted Lewis. â€œNo untethered movement. Stay strapped to your chair until you're latched to Beck.â€
line: â€œGood enough,â€ he said, reaching for the ship. â€œI'm drifting toward it. I think I can get my hand on some of the torn canvas...â€
line: â€œVisual on Watney!â€ He reported.
line: Watney released the straps on his chair. â€œRestraints off.â€
line: â€œ5 meters per second,â€ Johanssen replied.
line: puling and simply took in the line as they coasted toward him.
line: over the world in parks, bars, civic centers, living rooms, classrooms, and offices.
line: Mission Day 687 up here. And you know what? It doesn't matter what time it is on Mars cause I'M NOT FUCKING THERE!
line: Vogel went the other direction and closed the outer VAL door.
line: So now I'm waiting for the drugs to kick in. My ribs hurt like hel, my vision is stil blurry from acceleration sickness, I'm realy hungry, it'l be another 211 days before I'm back on Earth, and apparently I smel like a skunk took a shit on some sweat sockline: â€œHey, I know you!â€ Came a voice from behind.
line: you go?â€
