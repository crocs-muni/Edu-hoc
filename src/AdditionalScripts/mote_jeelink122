line: Wel. Beggars canâ€™t be choosers. â€œThreeâ€™s Companyâ€ it is.

line: The regulator uses freeze-separation to sort out the gasses. When it decides thereâ€™s too much oxygen, it starts colecting air in a tank
line: Long story short, I can trick the regulator in to puling al the oxygen out of the Hab. Then I can wear a spacesuit (so I can breathe) and do whatever I want without fear of blowing up. Yay!

line: Remember when they made you spend a day explaining your experiments to me? It was

line: â€œSol 549? How's that even possible?â€ Asked Bruce. â€œEven Iris wouldn't have landed til Sol 588.â€
line: â€œAfter that, they'd be on an accelerating orbit toward Mars, arriving on Sol 549. Like I said, it's a Mary flyby. This isn't anything like a normal Ares mission. They'l be going too fast to fal in to orbit. The rest of the maneuver takes them back to Ealine: â€œSuffice it to say,â€ Venkat interrupted, â€œIt would be very difficult and dangerous. But we have a lot of clever scientists to help him trick out the rover. Also there would be MAV modifications.â€
line: him right now. Both plans require the Taiyang Shen, so we can only do one.â€
line: â€œPointless to even ask her,â€ Venkat said. â€œWe need to make this decision; it's a matter of life and death.â€
line: â€œIt should,â€ Venkat said. â€œThe crew may have to fix things here and there, but they're wel trained. Remember, Hermes was made to do

line: â€œYeah, other than that,â€ Venkat interrupted.
line: Hey, man. How ya been?
line: Lewis would kill you.
line: Teddy sighed. â€œIt's a matter of risk,â€ he said. â€œIris 2 only risks one life. Rich Purnel risks al six of them. I know Rich Purnel is more likely to work, but I don't think it's six times more likely.â€
line: â€œNo they can't,â€ Teddy fired back. â€œThey're too emotionaly involved. Clearly, so are you. I'm not gambling five lives to save one.

line: I don't even know how to react. I'm choked up!

Then I stow the bedroom, and go back to the airlock for a normline: Even though it's possible, I don't rapid-inflate the bedroom. I did that to test it because I wanted to find where it'l leak.

Eventualy, things reached a balance point where the heat bled through the hul as fast as the RTG could add it. If you're curious, that balance point was a swelline: place and the vehicles were sharing life support again.
