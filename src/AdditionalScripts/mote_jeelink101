line: Letâ€™s seeâ€¦ where do I begin?
line: I guess I should explain how Mars missions work, for any layman who may be reading this. We got to earth orbit the normal way,
line: Suffice it to say we got to Mars 124 days later without strangling each other.
line: back to Hermes after surface operations were complete. The MAV was soft-landed (as opposed to the baloon bounce-fest the other
line: The MAV is a spaceship. It has a lot of delicate parts. It can put up with storms to a certain extent but it canâ€™t just get sandblasted
line: The last thing I remember was seeing Johanssen hopelessly reaching out toward me.
line: quickly evaporated from the airflow and low pressure, leaving only a gunky residue behind. More blood came in behind it and was also
line: So it did the only thing it could to keep me alive. It started back-filing with pure oxygen. I now risked dying from oxygen toxicity, as the excessively high amount of oxygen threatened to burn up my nervous system, lungs, and eyes. An ironic death for soline: I got the breach kit over the hole and sealed it. It held. The suit back-filed the missing air with yet more oxygen. Checking my arm
line: I knew it was hopeless, but I tried firing up the communication array. No signal, of course. The primary satelite dish had broken off,
line: yeah. They thought I was dead. How could they not?
line: Chapter 2
line: The MAV is gone, of course. My crewmates took it up to Hermes. Though the bottom half (the landing stage) is stil there. No reason
line: The solar cel array was covered it in sand, rendering it useless (hint: solar cels need sunlight to make electricity). But once I swept
line: Reclaimer.
line: Ares 4 wil be landing at the Schiapareli Crater, which is about 3,200km away from my location here in the Acidalia Planitia. No way
line: I dug out one of the rovers and had a good drive around, but after days of wandering I think itâ€™s time to give up. The storm probably
line: more than we needed. Al told, I have about 1500 hours worth of CO2 filters. After that, any EVAs I do wil have to be managed with
line: Thatâ€™s why I have a smal amount of Earth soil and a bunch of plant seeds with me.
line: I got my undergrad degree at the University of Chicago. Half the people who studied botany were hippies who thought they could
line: I found a big container and filed it with a bit of water, then added the dried shit. Since then, Iâ€™ve added my own shit to it as wel. The worse it smels, the more successful things are going. Thatâ€™s the bacteria at work!
line: supply of vitamins, al I need are calories of any kind to survive.
line: The first few EVAs were pretty inefficient; me filing smal containers and bringing them in through the airlock. Then I got wise and just put one big container in the airlock itself and filed that with smal containers til it was ful. That sped things up a line: me pretty sure plants need wet dirt to grow in. Not to mention the bacteria that has to live in it first.
line: After that, things got disgusting. I spent three hours spreading shit on Martian sand. I didnâ€™t have to do it with my hands, at least.
line: won't be much fun, what with me having died 11 days ago. Hel, they probably just got done gathering for my funeral.
line: pretty sure the ones I have wil germinate. Problem is I canâ€™t grow enough of them. In 62 square meters, I could grow maybe 150kg of
line: Shit.
line: the entire time period to stay alive for 1400 days total (the time til Ares 4 arrives)?
line: So weâ€™re up to 102.
line: The next thing to consider is how efficient I can be in growing potatoes. I based my crop yield estimates on the potato industry back on Earth. But potato farmers arenâ€™t in a desperate race for survival like I am. Can I get a better yield?
line: e of the Hab higher than normal, meaning my body expends less energy keeping its temperature. I could cut off an arm and eat it, gaining me valuable calories and reducing my overal caloric need.
line: assload more soil in to the Hab, even if it is dry and useless right now.
line: frozen? And why send them along with us as in-pressure cargo rather than in a crate with the rest of the Hab supplies? Because
line: proutable tubers within 40
line: Over the last few days, I got al the dirt in that Iâ€™d need. I prepped the tables and bunks for holding the weight of soil, and even put the dirt in place. Thereâ€™s stil no water to make it viable, but I have some ideas. Realy bad ideas, but theyâ€™re iline: suits. You need to be able to get people out without exposing them to the Martian atmosphere.
line: automaticaly replenish the air I lose with my entries and exits (what we NASA folk cal ingress and egress).
line: nerd in high school, but indeed I was). In the game I played a Cleric. One of the magic spels I could cast was â€œCreate Waterâ€. I always
line: scratch. Fortunately, I know the recipe: Take hydrogen. Add oxygen. Burn.
line: purpose is liberating oxygen from CO2. Yay Oxygenator!
line: The hydrogen wil be a little trickier.
line: we hit the atmosphere. If you think turbulence is rough in a jetliner going 720kph, just imagine what itâ€™s like at 28,000kph.
line: Thereâ€™s just one catch: Liberating hydrogen from Hydrazine isâ€¦ welâ€¦ it's how rockets work. Itâ€™s realy, realy hot. And dangerous. If
line: prevalent in my increasingly helish existence.
line: My idea is to make 600L of water (limited by the hydrogen I can get from the Hydrazine). That means Iâ€™l need 300L of liquid O2.
line: The best way to store the ingredients of water is to make them be water. So whatâ€™s what Iâ€™l have to do.
line: the Hab once stood.
line: CO2 for me.
line: pry the access panels off the MDV and get at the six Hydrazine tanks. I set them in the shadow of a rover to keep them from heating up
line: the valve output. Hydrazine is a liquid, so al I have to do is lead it to the reaction chamber (more of a â€œreaction bowlâ€ now).
line: body was now protected and I would be breathing canned air.
line: oc, while others are as big as a Hefty lawn and leaf bag.
line: aperture.
line: shit about it, but I also know Martinez is one stubborn son-of-a-bitch.
line: Point is, the process worked!
line: During this process, the poor Hab had to be the mother of a messy toddler. Itâ€™s been replacing the oxygen Iâ€™ve used, and the Water
line: LOG ENTRY: SOL 37
line: After my initial burst of 50L, I decided to settle down and just make it at the rate I get O2. Iâ€™m not wiling to go below a 25L reserve.
line: and the soil is certainly absorbing its fair share. But that doesnâ€™t account for 60L of missing water. Something was wrong.
line: went on its merry way. Dammit, Jim, Iâ€™m a botanist, not a chemist!
line: long to figure out how to deal with this.
line: But I canâ€™t get it to do that for hydrogen, because hydrogen needs to be below 21K to turn liquid. And the regulator just canâ€™t get
line: hydrogen on fire, but only until the smal bit of oxygen is used up.
line: Time to chow down and see what the good Commander brought along for music.
line: Theyâ€™l stil need some oxygen, but not much. I think a 1% content wil do the trick. That leaves a little in the air for the bacteria to
line: That was sarcasm, by the way.
line: The answer was pretty easy. I put al of them in Martinezâ€™s spacesuit. Then I dragged it out with me to the rover Iâ€™d set up as a
line: I canâ€™t blame it. Its whole purpose is to prevent the atmosphere from becoming lethal. Nobody at NASA thought â€œHey, letâ€™s alow a fatal lack of oxygen that wil make everyone drop dead!â€
line: O2 canister from the medical bay. That way, I had a hel of a lot more freedom of motion. It even had a rubber band to keep it on my face!
line: Taking a canister of O2 from Vogelâ€™s suit, I attached a strap to both ends and slung it over my shoulder. Then I attached an air line to the tank and crimped it with my thumb. I turned on a very slow trickle of O2; a smal enough that it couldnâ€™t overpline: My first thought was â€œMy ears hurt like hel!â€
line: Stil holding my breath, I glanced over to the spacesuit and Hefty bag Iâ€™d used to outsmart the regulator. The bad news is Iâ€™d never
line: I noticed for the first time how burned my clothing was. It was a good time to be wearing three layers of clothes. Mostly the damage
line: reason. Plus, I canâ€™t be sure there isnâ€™t a leak.
line: Then the Atmospheric Regulator. Again, no problem.
line: So what happened? Wel, I have a theory.
line: to water brought it back down again.
line: The problem was the exhale. Do you know how much oxygen you absorb out of the air when you take a normal breath? I donâ€™t know
line: of my life, my problem was the 60L shortfal in water production. 50L of it is now in Lewisâ€™s spacesuit, which Iâ€™l cal â€œThe Cisternâ€ from now on because it sounds cooler. The other 10L of water was absorbed by the dry soil.
line: Right?
line: day. Today was the memorial service for Mark Watney.
line: Venkat swiveled around. â€œGuess so,â€ he said.
line: â€œOk, run me through it. What, exactly, are you after?â€
line: â€œLike what? You think weâ€™d send people to Mars without being sure everything was in perfect working order?â€
line: need to concentrate on Schiapareli Crater.â€
line: â€œMark Watneyâ€™s body wil be within a twenty meters of the Hab. Maybe partialy buried in sand, but stil very visible, and with a comm
line: â€œNot forever,â€ Teddy said. â€œWithin a year, heâ€™l be covered in sand from normal weather activity.â€
line: â€œMasterâ€™s Degree in Mechanical Engineering,â€ she grumbled to herself. â€œAnd Iâ€™m working in an al-night photo booth.â€
line: for any sign on Mark Watneyâ€™s dead body. After a minute of fruitless searching, she was simultaneously relieved and disappointed.
line: Kapoorâ€¦ Yes, the Director of Mars Missionsâ€¦ Yes itâ€™s and emergency.â€
line: Main dish isnâ€™t around. No surprise there. Whatâ€™s the big emergency?â€
line: â€œYeah, um,â€ Mindy said, opening a document on her computer. â€œThis is the entire mission log for Sols 1 through 6. From MDV
line: Venkat looked back to the image. â€œWel obviously they activated somehow.â€
line: â€œFuck!â€ Annie said.
line: â€œSo I spent the last few hours checking everything I could. Commander Lewis had two outings in Rover 2. The second was on Sol 5.
line: completely removed, with considerable damage to the struts in the process. Thereâ€™s just no way that could have happened before liftoff. It would endanger the MAV way too much for Lewis to alow it.â€
line: â€œThisâ€™l be the most talked-about event since Apolo 11,â€ Annie said. â€œHow wil you keep it from them?â€
line: â€œStep one is communication,â€ Venkat said. â€œFrom the pics, itâ€™s clear the comm array is ruined. We need another way to talk. Once we
line: Teddy stood and opened his cel phone. â€œIâ€™m going to Chicago. Iâ€™l be back later today.â€
line: The two men in Venkatâ€™s office fidgeted in their chairs.
line: â€œ14 times,â€ Morris asserted.
line: â€œFailure of imagination,â€ Chuck said.
line: â€œWel,â€ Chuck said, â€œThe primary ran through the big satelite dish. It blew away in the storm. The rest of the backups were the MAV.â€
line: seats,â€
line: â€œIâ€™m getting sick of hourly press conferences,â€ Annie countered.
line: â€œThe public is engaged, and we wil do our best to keep everyone informed. Iâ€™ve recently learned CNN wil be dedicating a half-hour
line: â€œMeant every word of it,â€ Teddy said.
line: â€œWel,â€ Venkat began, â€œItâ€™s in the rough stages, but JPL thinks the MDV can be misused to save him.â€
line: â€œWonderful,â€ Teddy said, â€œSo weâ€™d be risking the lives of six more people in a very dangerous landing, re-liftoff, re-landing process.â€
line: â€œWork on that, too.â€
line: LOG ENTRY: SOL 63
line: ing can be done
line: Some stuff is obvious. Iâ€™l need to use a rover. Itâ€™l take a long time, so Iâ€™l need to bring supplies. Iâ€™l need to recharge en-route, and rovers donâ€™t have solar cels. Iâ€™l need to steal some from the Habâ€™s solar farm. During the trip Iâ€™l neline: Thereâ€™s just one complication. Heating.
line: Iâ€™l never actually get 90km on a single charge. Iâ€™l have hils to deal with, and rough terrain, sand, etc. But itâ€™s a good balpark. It tels me that it would take at least 35 days of travel to get to Ares 4. Itâ€™l probably be more like 50. But thatâ€line: I can put two stacks of 7 on the roof. Theyâ€™l stick out over the edges, but as long as theyâ€™re secure Iâ€™m happy. Every day, after
line: cels wil go. Thereâ€™s no room inside the cabin, and it wouldnâ€™t fit through the airlock anyway.
line: manâ€™s saddlebags for my rover.
line: The harness held. Hel yeah.
line: Wel, ok. It wasnâ€™t just me. Vogel and I worked together on it. And boy did we dril on it. We spent almost an entire week driling on the solar array alone. Then we driled more whenever they figured we had spare time. It had been deemed mission critical. line: and right edges, but I wonâ€™t be going through any tunnels so I donâ€™t care.
line: I dug them up, being careful to leave their plants alive. Then I cut them up in to smal pieces with one eye each, and re-seeded in to new dirt. If they keep growing this wel, I'l be able to last a good long time here.
line: The mission: Starting with fuly charged batteries, and having the solar cels on the roof, drive until I run out of power, and see how far I get.
line: So I shook it up a bit. I drove around randomly, making sure to stay within a kilometer of the Hab. A much more realistic test.
line: This wil require some thought. I have to ask myselfâ€¦ what would Hercule Poirot do? Iâ€™l have to put my â€œlittle gray celsâ€ to work on
line: The RTG houses the Plutonium, catches the radiation in the form of heat, and turns it in to electricity. Itâ€™s not a reactor. The radiation canâ€™t be increased or decreased. Itâ€™s a purely natural process happening at the atomic level.
line: Solar cels are great in the short-term, and theyâ€™re good for the long-term if you have humans around to clean them. But the MAV sits
line: I have two things working for me. First, I was assembling solar panels with Vogel when Commander Lewis drove off, and I saw she

line: The trip also proved my rigging worked. The solar cels and extra battery stayed beautifuly in place while traversing 8km of random
line: the RTG could barely keep up with it. In fact, it was a losing battle. Over time, heat would slowly leech out. Thatâ€™s fine. I can turn on the heater for short bursts when necessary.
line: I could have gone further, but I need life support while recharging. The CO2 gets absorbed through a chemical process, but if the fan

line: use standard filters (Apolo 13 taught us important lessons). Since then, Iâ€™ve used 131 hours of filter on various EVAs. I have 2089 left. 87

line: Oxygenator and Atmospheric Regulator and just fil the Hab with my breath over time. But CO2 is deadly to me. I need to release a bunch
line: few daysâ€¦ what do they mean? What progress has NASA made on a rescue option? And how wil this affect the Ares 4 preparations?
line: â€œWel,â€ Venkat began, â€œIt looks like heâ€™s preparing Rover 2 for a long trip. On Sol 65, he took the battery from the other rover and
line: â€œI hope not,â€ Venkat said. â€œThereâ€™s nothing at the site other than the MAV. None of the other presupplies. It would be a very long,
line: â€œIâ€™d heard that idea was rejected as being too dangerous,â€ Cathy said.
line: â€œYou asked my opinion. Donâ€™t like it? Go fuck yourself.â€
line: Venkat looked to Mitch â€œI put her in charge of tracking Watney. She gets us the imagery.â€
line: Mindy looked at the table and managed to say â€œâ€™k.â€
line: â€œHow dangerous is it?â€ Teddy asked.
line: â€œKeep me posted,â€ Teddy said. He turned to Mindy. â€œMiss Park. Welcome to the big leagues.â€
line: Teddy looked to Mitch. â€œMitch, your email said you had something urgent?â€
line: â€œI make that cal,â€ Mitch said. â€œIâ€™m the one who decides whatâ€™s best for the crew. And I say we bring them up to speed.â€
line: Venkat opened a folder and glanced at the paperwork inside. â€œI had every team check and double-check the longevity of their
line: â€œThatâ€™l be tight,â€ Bruce said. â€œMaking a presupply is a 6 month process. Weâ€™re set up to pipeline a bunch of them at once, not to
line: Bruce rubbed his eyes. â€œWeâ€™l do our best.â€
line: appreciate your continued support, Congressman, and hope you can sway the Committee toward granting us the emergency
line: Venkat sighed heavily. â€œMaybe itâ€™s just a longer test? An overnight trip, kind of thing?â€
line: â€œRecharging. Heâ€™s got al the solar cels set up,â€ Mindy said. â€œLast time he did that, it took 12 hours. I was going to sneak home for

line: Mark was no exception, but the way he showed it was to crack more jokes and get everyone laughing.â€
line: â€œThereâ€™s no way to be sure,â€ Irene said. â€œThe biggest threat is giving up hope. If he decides thereâ€™s no chance to survive, heâ€™l stop
line: After several seconds of complete silence in the studio, Cathy turned to the camera. â€œWeâ€™l be right back.â€
line: â€œThe rovers were only designed to communicate with the Hab and each other; the signal origin was presumed to be within 20km. The
line: â€œAl right, good work. Keep me posted,â€ Venkat said.
line: â€œThereâ€™s nothing for him to go around,â€ Mindy said. â€œItâ€™s Acidalia Planitia.â€
line: Venkat finished taking down the numbers. â€œCome with me,â€ he said, quickly walking out.
line: â€œThatâ€™s the Hab,â€ he said.
line: â€œPathfinder!â€ Mindy said. â€œHeâ€™s going to Pathfinder!â€
line: Chapter 9
line: Even more precious is my manure. Itâ€™s critical to the potato farm and Iâ€™m the only source on Mars. Fortunately, when you spend a lot
line: When the other battery runs out, itâ€™s time for another EVA. I pul the solar cels off the roof and lay them on the ground. For the first

line: came up with a briliant plan that didnâ€™t work.
line: So I navigate by Phobos. It whips around Mars so fast it actualy rises and sets twice a day, running west to east. Itâ€™s isnâ€™t the most
line: Iâ€™m finaly through the blank areas of the map. Tomorrow, Iâ€™l have the Lighthouse to navigate by, and Hamelin crater later on. Iâ€™m in
line: Up til now, Iâ€™ve been driving right over the rock-strewn landscape. But as I travel further south, the rocks are getting bigger and more plentiful. I have to go around some of them or risk damage to my suspension. The good news is I donâ€™t have to do iline: foot on Mars. The egress order had been determined years earlier. A month before launch, we al got tattoos of our â€œMars Numbers.â€
line: I knew I was in the right area when I spotted Twin Peaks in the distance. The two smal hils are under a kilometer from the landing site.
line: I canâ€™t explain how happy I was. It was a lot of work to get here, and Iâ€™d succeeded.
line: punishment.
line: It may not be fast, but it has great torque. I towed the panel away like a redneck removing a tree stump.
line: single stack. Itâ€™s a little more dangerous; they might fal over. The main thing it theyâ€™l be a pain in the ass to stack that high.
line: Weâ€™d have to come up with a system where NASA could talk by rotating the camera head. It would be painfuly slow.
line: And if thereâ€™s one thing Ares Valis has, itâ€™s rocks!
line: I stomped up and down the ramp first, to make sure it was stable, then I dragged the Lander up. It worked like a charm!
line: Chapter 10
line: So once again I am the desert wanderer, using Phobos to navigate, and hoping I donâ€™t stray too far. Al I need to do is get within 40km
line: During the boring-ass days, Iâ€™m working my way through â€œThe Six Milion Dolar Manâ€ from Commander Lewisâ€™s inexhaustible
line: Iâ€™l be home tomorrow. Even if the rover has a catastrophic failure, Iâ€™l be fine. I can walk to the Hab from here.
line: To dril this, they made us stay in the MAV simulator for 3 miserable days. Six people in an ascent vehicle originaly designed for a 23

line: would have cancer. So the Hab canvas shields from electromagnetic waves. This means the Hab itself it would block any transmissions if
line: LOG ENTRY: SOL 95
line: Then it was time to take a look at Sojournerâ€™s daddy. I suited up and headed out.
line: would not be working. Eventualy, the now unused battery wil lose its ability to retain charge.
line: So I knew what it needed. 1.5 volts.
line: Now I wait. And hope.
line: Theyâ€™d tel the Lander where Earth is, and it would angle the high-gain antenna appropriately. That there, the angling of the antenna, is how Iâ€™l know if it linked up.
line: BOOT SEQUENCE INITIATED
line: HIGAIN: OK
line: SOLAR C: NONFUNCTIONAL
line: The room burst in to applause and cheers. Venkat slapped an unknown technician heartily on the back while Bruce pumped his fist in
line: Venkat turned to Bruce. â€œGod damn, Bruce. You realy puled a rabbit out of your hat this time! Good work!â€
line: Tim shrugged. â€œYou can never tel with managers.â€
line: I just checked the Lander. The high gain antenna is angled directly at Earth! Pathfinder has no way of knowing where it is, so it has no way of knowing where Earth is. The only way for it to find out is getting a signal.
line: â€œUnfortunately, no,â€ he replied. â€œThe Lander hasnâ€™t been able to connect to Sojourner, and we have no way to contact it directly.â€
line: â€œHow so?â€ Marty asked.
line: to the communications console.
line: â€œMartian surfaceâ€¦â€ Venkat said as the lines displayed. â€œMore surfaceâ€¦â€
line: â€œAnother note,â€ said Tim, pointing to the screen as the slow march of data revealed itself.
line: I havenâ€™t been this excited about a â€œyesâ€ since prom night!
line: Each one would only get 13 degrees of arc. Even if JPL points the camera perfectly, thereâ€™s a good chance I wonâ€™t know which letter they meant.
line: Spell with ASCII. Numbers 0-F at 21 degree increments. Will watch camera starting 11:00 my time. When message done,
line: Câ€¦Râ€¦Oâ€¦Pâ€¦Sâ€¦?
line: Sâ€¦Jâ€¦Râ€¦Nâ€¦Râ€¦Nâ€¦Oâ€¦Tâ€¦Râ€¦Sâ€¦Pâ€¦Nâ€¦D
line: â€œIâ€™m al ears.â€
line: â€œItâ€™s the only option. The Habâ€™s radio is dead. Thing is, al the rover does is triangulate the signal to fix its location. It doesnâ€™t send data back to the Hab. It just has a voice channel for the astronauts to talk to each other.â€
line: â€œBut youâ€™re talking to me, so you have a solution, right?â€ Venkat probed.
line: software to add those 20 instructions. Then we broadcast the roverâ€™s patch to Pathfinder, which re-broadcasts it to the rover. The rover logs the bytes to a file. Finaly, Watney launches the file as an executable and it patches the rover software!â€
line: â€œHelo?â€
line: message just to tel him to pose for a photo. Besides, heâ€™l be in his EVA suit. You wonâ€™t even be able to see his face.â€

line: â€œBut-â€œ Annie said as he hung up.
line: Johanssen is a great programmer. She could talk Mark through it.â€
line: Ever transcribed 141 random bytes, one half of a byte at a time?
line: Itâ€™s night now, so no more messages. Tomorrow, Iâ€™l enter this in to the rover and the geeks at JPL can take it from there.
line: â€œTry updating a Linux server some time,â€ Jack said.
line: â€œIt worked!â€ Venkat announced to the room.
line: [11:41]JPL: Tell us about your â€œcropsâ€. We estimated your food packs would last
line: your work. Your life is at stake, so we want to be sure. Sol 900 is great news.
line: â€œCome in, Mitch,â€ Teddy said. â€œHave a seat.â€
line: got communication, we have a plan for rescue in the works, and his farm buys us enough time to get him supplies.â€
line: particularly labor-intensive, so he slept deeper and better than he had in a long time.
line: He sighed inwardly at the grimy feeling of another day without a shower.
line: Having rousted the troops, Lewis sat at the comm station to check overnight messages from Houston.
line: â€œJa, please,â€ Vogel responded.
line: Martinez, youâ€™l be with me outside. Johanssen, youâ€™re stuck tracking weather reports. Watney, your soil experiments are bumped up to
line: The darkness to the east undulated and flickered in the rays of the rising sun.
line: over, and bagging samples were trivial tasks.
line: â€œBack to base,â€ Lewis said.
line: by the minute.
line: â€œWe could use cables from the solar farm as guy lines.â€ He wheezed for a few moments, then continued. â€œThe rovers could be anchors.
line: Again, she was met with silence.
line: â€œLine up and walk west,â€ Lewis commanded. â€œSmal steps. Heâ€™s probably prone; we donâ€™t want to step over him.â€
line: says â€˜Bad Packet.â€™â€
line: The channel fel silent for some time. They continued pressing forward, shuffling through the sandstorm, hoping for a miracle.
line: â€œCopy that,â€ Lewis said. â€œEveryone home in on Martinezâ€™s suit. Thatâ€™l get you to the MAV airlock. Get in and prep for launch.â€
line: she lack visual references, the endless wind pushed her off course. The sheer volume of attacking sand buried her feet with each step.
line: â€œNeither do I, Doctor,â€ said Vogel, climbing the ladder. â€œBut the Commander has given us orders. Insubordination wil not help.â€
line: Bringing the radar online, he waited for it to complete a self check. Glaring at Beck, he said â€œWhatâ€™s the matter with you?â€
line: â€œWe canâ€™t leave her!â€ Beck yeled. â€œLet it tip, weâ€™l fix it!â€
line: â€œThanks for the tip,â€ Martinez said, maintaining the burn and watching the tilt readout. â€œCâ€™monâ€¦â€
line: â€œ10 percent if I donâ€™t fuck anything up,â€ Martinez said, adjusting the thrust angle.
line: â€œYeah, I see that,â€ Martinez replied. â€œItâ€™l be enough.â€
line: Lewis closed her eyes and nodded.
line: reached maximum acceleration. A limit defined not by the shipâ€™s power, but by the delicate human bodies inside.
line: â€œMain engine shutdown,â€ Martinez said. â€œAscent time: 8 minutes, 14 seconds. On course for Hermes intercept.â€
line: Traveling feet-first along the ladder, he soon had to grip it in earnest as the centripetal force of the rotating ship took hold. By the time he reached Semicone-A he was at 0.4g.
line: â€œMy son turned three yesterday,â€ He beamed. â€œShould be some pics of the party. How about you?â€

If the regulator fed that back to my air without reheating it, I'd be a Popsicle within hours. Most of the regulator's power goes to heating the return airline: To test, I shut down the heaters in the regulator and noted its power consumption. After a few minutes I turned them right back on

line: I bring it up because I dined on a meal pack today. I had saved 5 packs for special occasions. I ate the first of them 29 sols ago when I left for Schiapareli. I totaly forgot to eat the second when I reached the half-way point 9 sols ago. So I'm enjoyingline: Both loggers worked they way I'd hoped. I downloaded each of their video recordings to a laptop and advanced them to noon. Finaly

line: I'm stil going due south every day; and stil dealing with efficiency loss (though I'm keeping ahead of it). Every day of this crap I'm only getting 37km closer to the MAV instead of 90. Pissing me off.
line: perpendicular to my direction of travel, it means I'm south of the southernmost point of the cloud (presuming it's a circular storm. If it's not then fuck.)
line: I have an interesting opportunity here. And by â€œopportunityâ€ I mean Opportunity.
line: Right now, I can only have it set up when I'm inside the rover. It attaches to the airlock, so I can't get out if it's there. During my road trip that didn't matter, because I had to furl it every day anyway. But once I get to the MAV, I won't have to driline: the rest of the crew drives to wherever they are in the other rover and rescues them. The crew of the good rover detaches the pop tent

line: No, that doesn't sound good either...
line: The weather brought dunes and desert terrain. Nearby crater impacts brought rocks and boulders. The shape became uneven.
line: The rover, while descending down a seemingly ordinary slope, drove off an invisible ridge. The dense, hard soil suddenly gave way to
line: The pressure seal was not breached.
line: "No EVA," Mindy said. "The weather's clear. If he'd come out there'd be visible footsteps."
line: "Sure," Bruce said. "I'm just saying the rover is probably ok."
line: I got bounced around a lot, but I'm a wel-honed machine in times of crisis. As soon as the rover toppled, I curled in to a bal and
line: Also, since the trailer detached there's a good chance it's fucked up, too. The baloon roof it has isn't exactly durable. If it popped, the shit inside wil have flung out in al directions and I'l have to go find it. That's my critical life support.
line: I had an EVA and things aren't too bad. Mind you, they're not good.
line: So right now, I have a few problems to tackle: First, I need to right the trailer. Or at least get the weight off the baloon. Next, I need to right the rover. Finaly, I need to replace the rover's tow hook with the one on the trailer.
line: â€œI remember when you were shy.â€
line: At first I figured my top priority was the trailer. Then I changed my mind. After taking a good look at it, I decided I'd never be able to right it by myself. I'd need the rover.
line: perpendicular to the rover.
line: Beers for fucking everyone if I get back to Earth.
line: When I woke up this morning, the trailer hadn't popped yet. So that was a good start.
line: I hopped in the rover and drove it downhil, dragging the trailer with me. As I'd hoped, the trailer nosed in to the hole and tipped up.
line: Potato Skin Tea a few weeks ago. The less said about that the better.
line: I did a ful diagnostic on the Regulator and Oxygenator and I'm happy to report both are working perfectly.
line: Al told, that little fender-bender cost me 4 sols. But now I'm back in action!
line: Mechanical Engineer doesn't exactly have ladies lined up at the door. But stil, c'mon.
line: â€œSo it looks like he's fixed everything,â€ Mindy explained. â€œAnd his message today was 'ALL BETTER NOW' so I guess he's got
line: â€œUm...â€ Bruce said. â€œYeah, a few. This might not be the best venue for it. I'l be back in Houston with the procedure in a day or two.
line: â€œThe Ares 3 mission control team,â€ Mitch replied. â€œIt'l be in control room 2â€.
line: It was infuriating. We'd be on the freeway, cars blowing by left and right. Some of them would blare their horns because, honestly,
line: my god, I forgot how good real food tastes.
line: Holy shit this is awesome! Holy shit! Holy shit!
line: has to say, but it can talk to Earth no problem. Wel, there aren't any sand dunes between it and Earth when they talk.
line: both arms, as if in disbelief.
line: Wel, right this second, I'm back in the rover. I did go in to the MAV to do a systems check and boot-up. I had to keep my EVA suit
line: done! What's your status?

line: of Martian soil and rock samples. Obviously we won't do that. Also, there's just one passenger instead of six. That saves 500kg when you consider their weight plus their suits and gear. And we can lose the other 5 acceleration chairs. And of course, we'l line: â€œHmm,â€ Venkat said cautiously. â€œWe've never had a manned ship controled remotely before. But ok. Go on.â€
line: backups don't help us.â€
line: â€œWe'l have him cover it with Hab canvas.â€
line: â€œSure, can't wait.â€
line: Venkat sighed. â€œYou've removed most of the safety backups. What's this do to the estimated odds of failure?â€
line: tools you have on hand. Also, you'll need to start electrolyzing water to get the
line: the now-empty trailer would become my workshop.
line: is clear out a bunch of clutter, like chairs and control panels and the like. Once they're out, I'l have a lot of room in there to work.
line: â€œYou kiled Watney,â€ Lewis said.
line: â€œAye, Commander.â€ Martinez said.
line: â€œAl is wel,â€ Vogel said. â€œNo adjustments necessary. We are stil on track to planned trajectory within 4 meters.â€
line: I risk breaking the tether if I can't stop in time.â€
line: â€œGood,â€ Beck said. â€œAnd 214 meters isn't a hard limit, per se.â€
line: I've been puling critical hardware out of the MAV left and right. It's nice to know that my launch to orbit won't have any pesky back-

line: â€œFair enough,â€ Venkat said.
line: â€œOh,â€ Annie said. â€œSo we're just observers in al this?â€
line: This is it. There's nothing after this. There isn't even an abort procedure. Why make one? We can't delay the launch. Hermes can't stop
line: Everywhere on Earth, they gathered.
line: â€œGuidance.â€
line: â€œTelemetry,â€ Lewis's voice said over the speakers.
line: â€œAffirmative, flight,â€ came the response. â€œOur clocks are synched with theirs.â€
line: â€œYeah,â€ Johanssen said. â€œIt'l be strange to sysop a launch and stay in zero-g the whole time.â€
line: â€œHe cannot.â€
line: â€œIt's my own life at risk, and I say it's ok.â€
line: â€œSee you in a few, Commander,â€ Watney radioed back.
line: difficult, but something in the back of his mind told him that was bad.
line: â€œWatney,â€ Lewis said to her headset. â€œWatney, do you read? Can you report?â€
line: â€œThat's nice, too,â€ Mark thought.
line: â€œMuch smoother now,â€ Martinez said. â€œIt's not fighting me at al anymore.â€
line: â€œProbably passed out, Commander,â€ Beck said over the radio. â€œHe puled 12 G's on the ascent. Give him a few minutes.â€
line: â€œDid she say 68 kilometers!?â€ Beck said. â€œKilometers!? â€
line: â€œDepends on how much fuel we want to save for attitude adjustments on the trip home.â€
line: â€œDo it,â€ Lewis said.
line: big. So they're using the attitude adjusters to close the gap.â€
line: â€œSo what can they do?â€
line: â€œJohanssen,â€ Lewis said.
line: â€œTime to intercept?â€ Lewis asked.
line: â€œWatney!?â€ Came the reply.
line: â€œHow bad is it, Commander?â€ He asked.
line: â€œCopy,â€ Lewis said.
line: â€œI admit it's fataly dangerous,â€ Watney said. â€œBut consider this: I'd get to fly around like Iron Man.â€
line: â€œVogel's got software for calculating course offsets caused by hul breaches, right?â€
line: â€œWe'l seal the bridge and reactor room. We can let everywhere else go vacuo, but we don't want explosive decompression in here or
line: â€œBeck,â€ Lewis radioed, â€œHave you been hearing al this?â€
line: â€œYay! A plan!â€ Watney replied.
line: â€œRight,â€ Lewis said. â€œWe can open one door with the other shut, but how do we open the other?â€
line: â€œPressurizing Airlock-2,â€ Vogel reported. â€œHow wil we activate this bomb?â€
line: â€œNo point,â€ Lewis said. â€œIf the seal on the bridge doesn't hold we'l get sucked out at close to the speed of sound. We'l be jely with or without suits on.â€
line: â€œOne problem,â€ Lewis said. â€œI want the outer door locked in the fuly open position with the mechanical stopper in place to keep it
line: â€œWatney, how you doing?â€ Lewis's voice said in his ear.
line: â€œThing is,â€ Watney said, â€œI'm selfish. I want the memorials back home to be just for me. I don't want the rest of you losers in them. I

line: â€œI have used a single wire for igniting,â€ he explained. â€œI did not want to risk two wires for a spark. It would be dangerous to us if we had static while setting up.â€
line: â€œGood thinking,â€ Lewis said. â€œPrep the attitude correction.â€
line: â€œSorry for the delay,â€ Vogel said. â€œI was required to make a bomb.â€
line: â€œSeal the bridge and get to your station,â€ Lewis said.
line: â€œDead-on, Commander,â€ Martinez reported.
line: On the other side of the glass, Mitch paced to and fro.
line: The internal air of Hermes rushed through the open VAL, blasting Hermes in the other direction.
line: â€œWorry about that later,â€ Lewis said. â€œWhat's our relative velocity and distance to MAV?â€
line: Once free, he got his bearings. A quick look to his right showed him what he could not see from inside the airlock.
line: â€œHey Beck,â€ Watney said. â€œThe front's wide open. I'l get up there and be ready to grab at you.â€
line: â€œ1.1 meters per second,â€ Johanssen said.
line: Puling his head to the opening, he looked inside the compartment to see Watney strapped to his chair.

line: â€œThat's it for the fuel,â€ Beck said. â€œVelocity?â€
